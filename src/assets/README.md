## Assets folder

1.  It contains media files like images & videos in separate folders
2.  Sytle folder - includes the style files (.css) for global use
3.  Images can be of types: e.g (.jpg , .jpeg , .jfif , .pjpeg , .svg, .pjp, .webp etc)

### Naming convention

1. Folder names should be in lowercase only.
2. While naming image file name we should consider the following points:
    - All lowercase characters.
    - No spaces or underscore characters.
    - Use hyphens to separate words.
    - No other special characters except hyphens.
3. While naming css filename we should consider the following points:
    - Do Not Use Special Characters.
    - Do Not Use Any Spaces.
    - The Filename Should Start With a Letter.
    - Use All Lower Case.
    - Keep the Filename as Short as Possible.

> Note:If there are many image files required in the project, we can consider using svg sprite for svgs  or we can import all those files into a single file called index.ts and then export it.
