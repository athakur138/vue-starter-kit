## Components folder

This contains your Vue.js Components which make up the different parts of your page
and can be reused and imported into your pages, layouts and even other components.

It can contain folders like layouts, UIs etc.
We should follow View from MVVM(Model View ViewModel) model and structure the files accordingly.

### Naming convention

1. While naming folder names, we should follow Pascal Naming convention 
2. We should name our .vue files using Pascal Naming convention

> Note:
> More folders can be added or removed according to the needs of the project.
