### Store

For State management in vue,we will be using Pinia which is recommended by Vue.
Pinia is a store library for Vue, it allows you to share a state across components/pages.

### Naming convention

-   Files names should be in camelCase
-   The unique name, also referred to as id, is necessary and is used by Pinia to connect the store to the devtools.
-   Naming the returned function **_use.._** is a convention across composables to make its usage idiomatic.
