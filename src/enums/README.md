## Enums

Enums allow a developer to define a set of named constants. Using enums can make it easier to document intent, or create a set of distinct cases. TypeScript provides both numeric and string-based enums.

### Naming convention

-   Enum files should be in lowercase and enum name should be in Pascal Case and their keys would be all uppercase in case of object.
-   We should use .ts file only for enums
    > If enum is going to be used only in a specific component then keep it in that file otherwise keep it under enum folder
