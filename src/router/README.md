### Router

Vue router helps us to map each route to the component that should display. It provides end-users a Multi Page Application (MPA) like experience without even refreshing the page.

### Naming convention

-   The index.ts file is created to register all the necessary routes.
-   A route file should be named according to the feature or functionality in camelCase.
> Necessary route files can be introduced only when  it is certain that we are going to use ovewhelming routes in a project otherwise always try to keep only index.ts  as much as possible.
