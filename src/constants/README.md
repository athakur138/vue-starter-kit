## Constants Folder

All the constant used through out the project Should be saved here in single file

### naming convention

constant file should name as follows:
Featurename.ts - Here the 'Featurename' can be named related to requirements. E.g. Product.ts

> If a constant is going to be used only in a specific component then keep it in that file otherwise keep it under constants folder
