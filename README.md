## Vue Typescript boilerplate

It is the boilerplate to get started a vue project. We can make further necessary changes according to the project needs with time.

Following are the important tools we used in this boilerplate:

-   **Vuetify 3** - A Vue JS UI library with beautifully handcrafted Vue Components.
-   **Pinia** - Official Vue JS state management library.
-   **ESLint** - Linter for JS
-   **Prettier** - Code formatter

## Prerequisites

- Node:>=16.0.0
- npm:>=9.0.0

## Installation and setup

- Run `npm i ` to install all the required packages and dependencies for this boilerplate.
- Run `npm run dev` to start your development server.
